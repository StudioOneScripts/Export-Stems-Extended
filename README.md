## EXPORT STEMS EXTENDED

This script temporarily adds numerical prefixes to channel names 
during stem export, preserving the songâ€™s channel order on the 
computer file system. This also maintains the correct track order 
when importing stems into other audio workstations. 

The prefixes are automatically removed after the stem export, 
leaving the session unchanged.
