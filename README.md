# EXPORT STEMS EXTENDED

This script adds a missing feature to PreSonus Studio One (c) by 
temporarily adding numerical prefixes to channel names during stem
export, preserving the songâ€™s channel order in the exported files. 
 
This also maintains correct track order when importing the files 
into other workstations. The prefixes are automatically removed 
after the stem export, leaving the session unchanged.

## Installation
Download the package and put it in the application \Scripts folder.  
The command will appear in the "External" category in key commands.
